  <h1>The Story So Far...</h1>
  <h2>Into the Uncharted Worlds of Essentia</h2>
  <h3>Explore Essentia</h3>
 <p>Slayers of Rings & Crowns takes place in the universe Essentia. Essentia hosts thirteen planets, some with many moons, a main sun and a dying star. Players’ journeys begin on the fourth planet, Zailister (Zail), which is Essentia’s most balanced planet between sorcery and technology, and is most rich in life-dependent resources. Players can explore the other planets and uncharted territories via rifts, trade post portals, space flight travel, summons, unwillful abduction and even hell gates found in labyrinths.</p>
<p>Each planet has its own time period, distinct seasons, biomes and landscapes. Featuring two suns, the main life giving sun, Adoria, and the dying star, Tawdry Dwarf which lies between the ninth and tenth planets and barely gives life to planets eight through thirteen. Technology progresses from planet to planet in an outward order from Adoria's magic emitting radiance on through the seventh planet.</p>
<p>The first planet, Ingnis, too hot for most to bear, features prehistoric themes with dinosaurs, cro magnon, neanderthal, hominids, and many giant species of critters and flora and fauna. Ignis is host to the sources of ancient magic and medieval steel, while sci-fi futuristic warfare has developed in the last four planets, holding onto Tawdry’s last bits of light and warmth.</p>
<p>The year is 10,023 EA (Eons of Adoria or years).</p>
<p>The Omnè, natives of the tenth planet, aware of Tawdry Dwarf's dwindling energies, have accelerated their technological advancements. Affected by the flickering star, the Omnè have innovated by constructing atmospheric vessels and developing a new planet using organic technology to ensure survival. Utilizing these advancements, the Omnè target other planets, notably Zail, aiming to secure its abundant resources as their new settlement.</p>
<p>Zail is already war-torn, and is vulnerable to attacks, although the poorly led Noble, Feral and Purge forces now stand together in a truce to hold the invading Omnè back. Zail is host to an ancient and practiced prophecy where nineteen crowns were formed in a cataclysmic event involving magic particles and debris of its surrounding Rings being drawn to enormous falling stars. These stars, visible to Zail's inhabitants, shrunk to crown size as they fell through the atmosphere and became mystical crowns that hold unique magical properties.</p>
<p>One by one, the crowns struck the earth and seas of Zail and were scattered about the planet. Upon finding one, only a true bearer could wear their respective crown. Any usurper that attempted to wear the crown could not bear its weight or harness its power.</p>
<p>Desperate for their true leaders after losing them to war and coups, Zailians of all fourteen races knew the general areas of the crowns because of their atomic impacts and destruction left behind. Regardless of the impact, finding the crowns still took several thousand grueling years before each of the fourteen territories had crowned a true leader, many lineages past the unknown rulers at the time.</p>
<p>Only the Arch Elves’ former ruler, Elendriel Dropleaf, witnessed the original events and is also the one that held the Noble Forces together as a high ranking general. Elendriel is no longer a part of the Noble Forces, but never passes up an opportunity to join the fight against the Omnè.</p>
<p>Diplomatic actions of greed, chaotic events between believers and non believers of the prophecy, and war, six crowns have been either lost or destroyed, bringing these regions’ populations back to chaos, strife and peril.</p>
